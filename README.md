Welcome to the Vegetable Freshness Detection (VFD) project! This Flutter application allows users to capture photos of vegetables and quickly determine their freshness level. Powered by a deep learning model trained on a dataset of over 500,000 images, VFD provides a classified output indicating whether the vegetable is fresh, rotten, or semi-rotten. 🌿🍅🥕

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use VFD, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ParthJohri/Vegetable-freshness-detection.git`
2. Install Flutter dependencies: `flutter pub get`
3. Run the application: `flutter run`

## 📸 Taking Photos

Using VFD is as easy as taking a picture! Open the application and point your camera towards a vegetable you wish to evaluate. Capture the photo by tapping the shutter button. VFD will analyze the image using its deep learning model to determine the freshness level of the vegetable. 📷🔍

## 🌱 Freshness Classification

Once the analysis is complete, VFD provides a classified output based on the freshness of the vegetable:

- 🌿 Fresh: Indicates that the vegetable is in good condition and safe to consume.
- 🍅 Rotten: Indicates that the vegetable has spoiled and should be discarded.
- 🥕 Semi-Rotten: Indicates that the vegetable is partially spoiled and may not be suitable for consumption. Exercise caution when deciding to use or discard it.

VFD's classification system helps users make informed decisions about the freshness of their vegetables, promoting healthier eating habits and reducing food waste. 🌍🍽️
